# Beatbattle.app

A web application built for beat battle competitions.

TODO: Update nickname system, add ICON/avatar
MORE PRESENT UPLOAD SUCCESS MSG

SET REDDIT USER AGENT PROBABLY

MOVE SOUNDCLOUD/URL PROCESSING WORKLOAD TO THE TEMPLATE WITH ZINGGRID (URL AS REFERENCE)
for searches, should I move the search bar to the top and process them on my own, then I can get rid of that big black bar and make the top part the sortable shit?

PERF TAG = MIGHT MAKE PERFORMANCE WORSE

TOAST TO CASES
MAKE SUBMIT URL IF UNAPPROVED KEEP FORM DATA
Current ideas: Add options to disable voting (in this case maybe program a front end for the challenge owner to rank the tracks), disqualify non voters, add sequel option and chain of challenges, verified tag for official challenges, combining login methods, add group/subreddit restricted challenges, moderator/admin features, live deadline (might be a pain to do), add challenge end date time stamp to finished challenges, make submit data persist on error
Add “advanced options” like disabling randomization during vote, showing names at all times, etc
Proper password support
sorry i'll put this in suggestions in the app but maybe next to the max vote count should be votes remaining count as well
DRAFT STATUS AND PUBLISH DATE

FIX THIS - Rules: Submit your &#34;vs. the count&#34; beat and then vote for your favorite!
