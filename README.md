To-do -

JULY 23
To-do
Finish javascript cleanup
Add deleting groups.
Battle.Host should be a user object so we can have expanded functionality.
Database actions should return the value as well as an error in order to be idiomatic.
Consistently used stuff (ie: Ads, Alert Messages) should be put into a type so it's easier to maintain.
<div class="battle-information"> should be extrapolated into a template for maintainability purposes.
